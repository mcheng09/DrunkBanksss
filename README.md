# DrunkBanks

Hello there! My name is Mike Cheng and I'd like to present to you my fourth and final project for the WDI program.

DrunkBanks is a mobile-friendly app that can be used to make drunk bets with friends and other users. Users can create any bet at any price! Users can also volunteer for other user's bets. When the bet is done, the better can pay the bet through credit card. Did you just come up with a great idea for a bet? See if anyone will do it!
